# Domino Physics Simulation

An interactive web-based domino physics simulation. Place dominoes on the canvas and watch them fall under realistic physics.

## Features

- **Place Dominoes**: Click the left mouse button on the canvas to place a domino at that position.
- **Knock Down**: Click the right mouse button to apply a force to the nearest domino, causing it to fall.

## Project Generation

This project was automatically generated by **Trae (Cline) AI Assistant**.

**Trae** is a powerful AI programming assistant that integrates advanced language models to quickly create and modify code projects based on user requirements.

## Tech Stack & Libraries

This project uses the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: Used for basic page structure
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the page
- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing logic and interactions

### Third-party Libraries

- **[Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/)**: A powerful 2D physics engine for rigid body physics simulation.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).
2. Download or clone all project files to a local folder.
3. Find the `index.html` file in the folder.
4. Open `index.html` with your web browser.
5. Once the page loads, you can start placing and knocking down dominoes on the canvas.

## Code Structure Overview

### index.html
- Defines the basic page structure including title, instructions, and `<canvas>` element for the simulation
- Imports all necessary CSS and JavaScript files

### style.css
- Contains styling rules for fonts, colors, layout, and canvas borders/background colors
- Ensures a clean and beautiful user interface

### script.js
- Core logic of the project
- Uses Matter.js to create physics world, renderer, and static objects like ground and walls
- Defines functions for creating domino rigid bodies
- Sets up mouse interactions distinguishing left-click (place domino) and right-click (knock down)

### matter.js
- Matter.js library file providing all necessary physics simulation functionality

## Customization & Extension

You can customize the simulation by modifying parameters in `script.js`:

- **Domino Size**: Modify `dominoWidth` and `dominoHeight` values in the `createDomino` function
- **Gravity**: Change the value of `engine.world.gravity.y` to adjust gravity strength
- **Knock Force**: Modify the force vector `{ x: ..., y: ... }` in the `Body.applyForce` function to change the force applied by right-click
- **Colors**: Change color values in the `render.fillStyle` property of `Bodies.rectangle` to customize colors of ground, walls, or dominoes
